## Insight 1 
I'm already thinking like a solutions architect. With my desire to be a bridge between analytics teams and data engineering demonstrates that I am thinking with a solution-oriented mindset. 

## Insight 2
I have more experience in this field then I originally thought! My work in BigQuery and Databricks (even with just simple SQL) has exposed me to cloud based solutions and both stuctured and semi-structured data. My work building and supplying semantic models in Power BI is within the parameters of work in the data pipeline. So, I'm not starting from scratch like I originally thought I was. 

## insight 3
I should start small with sample automation and documentation processes. I can start identifying and documenting redundant manual processes now and use my class project to hopefully explore how these processes could be automated. This will help me speak with Purina's data architecture team more fluently and open doors for potential stretch work. 

## Insight 4
Learning and understanding the Data Engineering Lifecycle will build more credibility with engineering teams. My goal is to focus on truly understanding the data lifecycle, from ingestion to serving. Developing a strong understanding of this framework will be instrumental in helping me ask better questions, design more comprehensive handoffs and collaborate more effectively with Purinas dedicated data architecture team.
